• imported the packages needed for analysis
• imported the data of the last month of the people who interacted with the program
• removing the NULL data from the dataset
• filtering out the data that has incorrect date
• defining datatype of columns for analysis
• renaming data in columns for easier analysis and better understanding
• adding column of duration of trips by subtracting the end time of ride by start time
• getting insights about data for analysis (mean, average, max, min)
• defining riders potentials to be actual members to the program by their ride duration if the casual member ride more than 15 min then he's a potential customer
• categorizing the customers to (potential members, non potential, subscriber)
• filtering out non potential customers who where not serious about the program ( ride length were less than 15 min) {personal preference}
• calculating the percentage of potential customers to subscribers 
• viualize the data 

conclusion : due to data insights and dashboards i figured that customers who are not yet subscribers had longer ride duration so a marketing campaign might focus on offering a period of time with a discount rate for new subscribers to attract them to subscribe to the porgram
